# Hack with a Pro
Table 4's repo for Hack with a Pro 2024! Our 3rd-place-winning final project is Our Fridge, an easy ingredient sharing website that allows users to share leftover ingredients with their friends through a communal fridge. Our Fridge uses email notifications to let a friend know that a user wants an ingredient, and generates easy recipes that can use the leftover ingredients accumulated by the group.


# To set up the project
## Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm start
```

## Backend 
```bash
cd server
pip3 install REQUIREMENTS.txt
python3 server.py
```
